# XBFDecompiler 1.0

Simplest XBF ("XAML files") decompiler.

## About
To make the normal WP8 app reverse engeneering, you need this simple and cool tool to "re-construct" XAML files (from XBF-files that you can find at appxbundle "archive"). This thing needed at some moments where R.E. tools can't complete "full reverse" of .exe/.dll due some specifics (UWP / ARM / WP8 / etc.)
